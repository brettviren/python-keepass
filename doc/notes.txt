Notes on KeePass file format v3 (as comes with KeyPass 1.x or KeyPassX).

* Basics

 * Retrain fingers, it's spelled kEEpass, not kEYpass.
 * Header unencrypted, payload encrypted with a master key that gets
   munged.
 * Format partially documented in Docs/DbFormat.txt int the source.


* Other work

Japanese hacker: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/rudi/20101003/1286111011 has
same idea, amazingly this post is from this month!

He translates the necessary crypting as such:

#+begin_src python
# Header to parse
header = parse_db (buffer)
# Masterpass a sha256
key = hashlib.sha256 (masterpass). digest ()
ECB mode using a # seed_key create AES
cipher = AES.new (header.seed_key, AES.MODE_ECB)
The AES key to encrypt # seed_rot_n times
for i in range (1, self.header.seed_rot_n):
    key = self.cipher.encrypt (key)
# Key to sha256
finalkey = hashlib.sha256 (key). digest ()

# Header a encription iv using AES CBC-mode and create a
cipher = AES.new (finalkey, AES.MODE_CBC, header.enc_iv)
# Decrypt
buf = cipher.decrypt (buf)
# Get the character code of the last letter
extra = ord (buf [-1])
# Cut only a few minutes of the character code
buf = buf [: len (buf)-extra] # last len (extra) becomes blank
#+end_src
